to reproduce the SSL bug

1) install latest eclipse with the PDE (Plugin Development Environment)
2) import the plugin projest from this repo
3) run the project ("Run As -> Eclipse Application")
4) open a browser, set ssl proxy to localhost:9095 and try opening some "https://..." url
5) this will fail due to the bug in the ResourceExtractor (see attached screenshot)
